# CS-348
CS 348 Final Project

To load our sample database, we downloaded sports data from online datasets and transformed it into how we plan on structuring our database. 
An example is as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------
First Name | Last Name | Sport | Team | Age | Statline |
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Auston   | Matthews  | NHL   | Toronto Maple Leafs | 25 | ...
  Kyle     | Lowry     | NBA   | Toronto Raptors     | 36 | ...
  
We are currently experimenting with how we want the database to be structued to make it more efficient and easily retrieve data so this model is a sample
for milestone 0.
